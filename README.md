# StaffMap

StaffMap was designed to automate various management processes with a focus on employee management, resource control and payment processing. The backend responsible for performing core functions such as scheduling, resource tracking, and payment distribution. But we had to stop development due to changes in the market. This is something we don't mind showing to others

### Project Status
Unfortunately, the project did not achieve its intended success, and development was discontinued. The backend code is now available in the public domain for educational and reference purposes.
